What I learned:

I learned many things about the different computer hardware and number systems. The one hardware I learned the most and found the most 
interesting wasthe research I did on printers. I learned how far back printers have gone to when it was first invented, the different 
printers that were invented through time up to today, and the one printer I found the most interesting, was the 3D printer that's the 
most recent one to be made today. 
When I skimmed through all the other websites my classmates made on other computer hardware and number sytems, I didn't really find many 
cool information, for I had very little time to read through, 


What I still want to learn:
