        <h2><em>What is the history of this computer part?</em></h2>
      <li><strong>1938-1947 <em>(Electrophotography)</em><br></strong> 
      Chester Carlson invented a dry printing process called 
      electrophotography commonly called a Xerox.
      From 1939 to 1944 Carlson was turned down by more than 20 companies. 
      Finally, in 1947 the inventor managed to facilitate a deal with a small, 
      completely unknown photo-paper company Haloid (later renamed Xerox), 
      giving them the right to develop a xerographic machine. <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      <li><strong>1953-1959 <em>(Xerox)</em></strong> <br> 
      In 1953, the first high-speed printer was developed by Remington-Rand. Six years later, 
      in 1959, twenty years after Carlson invented xerography, 
      the first Xerox office copier 914 was presented to the public.
</li>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      <li><strong>1962-1970</strong></li> 
      In 1962 Chuck Winston's electrostatically deflected droplets single nozzle inkjet patent 3,060,429 issued. 
      Although this inkjet printer did not show up commercially until 1966 when AT&T's Long Lines Project 176 
      produced and delivered the Inktronic 100 WPM TTY printer. 
      <br> According to Xerox, the original laser printer called EARS was 
      developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center beginning in 1969.
<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      <li> <strong>1971-1985</strong> </li>
      EARS (original laser printer) was completed in November, 197. Xerox Engineer,
      Gary Starkweather adapted Xerox copier technology adding a laser beam to it to come up with the laser printer. 
      In 1972 Steve Zoltan's Drop-On-Demand single nozzle inkjet patent 3,683,212 was issued. 
      According to IBM, "the very first IBM 3800 was installed in the central accounting office at F. W. Woolworth’s North American 
      data center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1976." The IBM 3800 Printing System was the industry’s first high-speed, laser printer.
      This nozzle technology was installed on a Quip Inkjet facsimile printer at Exxon Office Systems in 1979.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      <li><strong>1986-1992</strong></li></li>
      Steve Zoltan's Drop-On-Demand single nozzle inkjet patent inspired the improved Teflon molded nozzle material use in Howtek, 
      Inc., Pixelmaster full color Thermoplastic ink printer product introduced in 1986. 
      It used 32 nozzles in a rotary printhead and printed on standard office paper sheets. 
      Printing in paper multiple times produced characters in 3D. This had been seen at Exxon Office Systems 
      years before but didn't produce a 3D patent idea by Richard Helinski until 1987. 
      Finally in 1992, Hewlett-Packard released the popular LaserJet 4, the first 600 by 600 dots per inch resolution laser printer.


        <h2> <em> Why was this computer part developed? </em></h2>
      When printing was invented, it was noted that there was a general desire in people for learning throughout 
      Europe and this invention made books cheaper and improved the ability in people to read more books. 
      In order to grasp more knowledge, people started to learn to read and in order to communicate with others 
      who were not within the talking distance, they started to learn writing. 
      Thus, printing became important as it gave knowledge to be spread among many instead of keeping
      it restricted to the few.Printing also became important in children's life as printed books and schooling is 
      compulsory for all the children in the country. 

        <h2> <em>What does this computer part connect to?</em> </h2> <h3> Printers:</h3> 
      Printers are connected to computer systems in a variety of ways. 
      Small desktop printers are usually connected directly to a computer's USB port. 
      Older printers are connected to a parallel or “printer” port. Some printers are directly connected to a network, 
      making it easy for multiple computers to share them. A few printers use a rare serial port connection.

        <h3>Tape Storage:</h3>
    Tape drives can be connected to a computer with SCSI (Small Computer System Interface), 
    Fibre Channel ( a high-speed network technology used to connect computer storage to servers), USB, or other networks.

          <h2> <em>What is this computer part?</em> </h2>
      <h3><strong>Printers</strong></h3> A printer is a device that accepts text and graphic 
      output from a computer and transfers the information to paper, usually to standard size sheets of paper. Printers vary in size, 
      speed, sophistication, and cost. In general, more expensive printers are used for higher-resolution color printing.

 <h3><strong>Inkjet Printers</strong></h3> A type of computer printing that recreates a digital 
      image by propelling droplets of ink onto paper, plastic, or other substrates.

 <h4>Laser Printers</h4>An electrostatic digital printing process. 
    It produces high-quality text and graphics by repeatedly passing a laser beam back and forth over a 
    negatively charged cylinder called a "drum" to define a differentially charged image. 
    The toner is transferred to a piece of paper and fixed by a heating process.

 <h4> Dot Matrix Printers</h4> 
  Type of computer printer where images are applied to paper by a print head that strikes the paper through a ribbon embedded with ink,
  similar to an old fashioned typewriter. The print head transfers one line of text or one thin slice of a graphic at a time, 
  using an array of little dots to assemble the print,
  and moves back and forth across the page while advancing the paper little by little until the printing is complete.

 <h4>3D Printers</h4> A machine that allows the creation of a physical object from a three-dimensional digital model, 
  typically by laying down many thin layers of a material in succession. 
  That material is joined or solidified under computer control to create the object, with material being added together. 
  3D printing is used in both rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing. 
  3D Printers are typically used by the Aerospace, Medical, Dental, Defence, Automotive and Architecture industries.

 <h3> Tape Storage:</h3> A tape drive is a data storage device that reads and writes data on a magnetic tape. 
  Magnetic tape data storage is typically used for offline, archival data storage.
  Tape media generally has a favorable unit cost and a long archival stability

          <h2> <em>What are the costs for the part?</em> </h2>

          <h3> Budget Version</h3> The dot-matrix printer was a popular low-cost personal computer printer.
          It's an impact printer that strikes the paper a line at a time.
          The best-known non-impact printers are the inkjet printer,
          of which several makes of low-cost color printers are an example, and the laser printer.
          The inkjet sprays ink from an ink cartridge at very close range to the paper as it rolls by.
          The laser printer uses a laser beam reflected from a mirror to attract ink (called toner ) 
          to selected paper areas as a sheet rolls over a drum.
          <h3><strong>High-End version</strong></h3>

 <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWUaJXnZjzGEvTRjtsqF7N-650-80.jpg" width="300"><hr> 
 The MakerBot Replicator+ is the successor to the popular MakerBot Replicator 3D printer,
 and the new version has brought improvements to nearly every part of the Replicator.
 This means the Replicator+ is faster and quieter than the previous version,
 while maintaining its excellent design and safety features.
 This desktop 3D printer is expensive, but it offers excellent print quality,
 and uses 1.75mm polylactic acid (PLA) filament. It's also user-friendly enough for home users and hobbyists to use
 - as long as your budget can stretch to the high asking price.
        <h2><em> Interesting Facts!</em></h2>
<h3>Tape Storage</h3>
Magnetic storage is very durable.
Tapes have a much longer useful life and are less prone to the risks of modern drives.
In fact, magnetic tapes can be read securely, even after 30 years,
while the average hard drive scarcely lasts five years
